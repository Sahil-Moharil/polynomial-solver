C++ Polynomial Interpolation Solver
This program calculates the coefficients of a unique polynomial that passes through a given set of data points. It reads the points from a JSON input, where each point is defined by a numeric key (the x-value) and a value object (containing the y-value and its base).

This project is written in C++ and uses the Boost Multiprecision library to handle arbitrarily large integer calculations, ensuring accuracy for complex test cases.

Dependencies
A C++ compiler that supports C++17 (e.g., g++, Clang).

The Boost C++ Libraries (specifically, the multiprecision component).

How to Build
You can compile the program using a standard C++ compiler like g++. Make sure the Boost libraries are correctly installed and accessible by your compiler.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

# Replace 'solver.cpp' with the name of your source file
g++ -std=c++17 solver.cpp -o program

This will create an executable file named program.

How to Run
The program reads the JSON data from standard input. The easiest way to provide the data is to save it in a file (e.g., input.json) and use input redirection.

Create a file named input.json.

Paste one of the test cases below into the file.

Run the program with the following command:

./program < input.json

The output will be printed directly to the console.
